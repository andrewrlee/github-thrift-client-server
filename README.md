# github-thrift-client-server

This project currently consists of 3 clojure projects:

 - api     
 - feeder
 - server

The api project builds the library jar which contains classes generated by thrift. This is shared by both the client and the server. The feeder application pulls information about "push" events from github and then sends them via thrift to a server. The test server implementation in server/testserve.clj just stores the received push events in memory.  

The feed traversal has been implemented as a lazy sequence of single events which transparently loads additional pages of events as required. 

## Installation

### API

First, build the api project:

1.) Download [thrift](http://thrift.apache.org/) tarball:
   * `./configure` ensuring that java support is enabled (depends on java 1.7+ and ant).
   * `make && make install`

2.) Ensure the `thrift` executable is available on the path.

3.) run `lein jar` to generate the class files from thrift definitions.

4.) run `lein install` to install the library in the local maven repo.

This will make the library available to other projects.

### Server

Build the server jar:

```
cd server
lein uberjar
```

Launch the server: `HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=9000 java -jar feeder-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar`

If env variables not specified it has the following defaults: 
 
|Defaults:      |
|-----|---------| 
|HOST |localhost|
|PORT |8080     |

### Client

Then get an api token from [github](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens) and add an env variable to `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

```clojure
{:user
  {:env { :github-token   "<api-token>"}}}
```

and then fire up the repl: `lein repl` 

## Usage

Running the test server in the repl:

```clojure
feeder.client> (server-healthy?)
INFO > Sun Feb 22 16:36:58 GMT 2015 > Healthy!
feeder.client> (server.testserve/get-stored-events-size)
0
feeder.client> (post-recent-push-events)

requesting: https://api.github.com/events?page=10
finished pushing batch
feeder.client> (server.testserve/get-stored-events-size)

```
##TODO

* Implement daemon style functionality in the feeder - polling at a set interval.
* Use logback or some clj logging framework 
* Proper error handling
* Make client configurable (host/port)
* Add server written in a different language.
* Better namespace names
* Tests!
